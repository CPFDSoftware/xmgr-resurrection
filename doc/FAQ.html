    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>Where can I get the most recent version of xmgr?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The sources of the most recent version of xmgr are 
located at the URL:
<P>
ftp://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/pub/xmgr4/src/xmgr-latest.tar.gz
<P>
You can fetch it from a mirror site as well. The list of mirror sites can 
be found at

    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>How do I subscribe to/unsibscribe from the xmgr mailing list?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Xmgr has three mailing lists: acegr, acegr-announce and acegr-dev. The first one, unmoderated, serves for general
discussions of xmgr. You can subscribe to it by sending an email to
acegr-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il with no subject line and the only word 'Subscribe' (without
quotes, of course) in the body of the message. You may instead wish to subscribe to the digest of the list by
sending same email to acegr-digest-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il. The digest is sent once in a
three days or when its size exceeds 32K. 
<P>
The moderated acegr-announce list is for new version or serious bug fix announcements only (which are
automatically relayed to the first mailing list, too). The address to send subscription requests is
acegr-announce-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il. 
<P>
The acegr-dev mailing list is for developers. The -request address is acegr-dev-request@plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il.
<P>
To unsubscribe from a list, same instructions apply, with "Subscribe" being replaced by "Unsubscribe". </TD>

<TR><TH COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="1">1. Compilation problems</A></TH>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="1.0">1.0</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>When I try to compile xmgr I get message like:<BR>
<I>Makefile: Must be a separator on line 55</I></TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>This message means you have to use a more descent `make' utility,
like the GNU make, available on many systems as `gmake'. Starting with version 4.1.1, xmgr should compile with any vendor-supplied
'make' utility.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="1.1">1.1</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>While compiling xmgr I get error messages about missing 
include files.
</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The answer to this question varies:
<P>
     a. The include files are there but in a non-standard place. Check with your
        local sys admin.<BR>
     b. If the missing files are like Xm/*.h, this means you don't have Motif
        development kit installed (or again, you have to tell explicitly  to
        compiler where to look for the header files). This mostly concerns
        Linux.<BR>
     c. If compiler complains about missing Xbae/Matrix.h, you need either to 
        install the Xbae widget library version 4.5 (available from 
        ftp://ftp.x.org/contrib/widgets/motif/) or disable the use of the widget
        in Make.conf file. In the later case, however, you won't get the 
        semi-spreadsheet set editor.</TD>


<TR><TH COLSPAN=3 ALIGN=LEFT><A NAME="2">2. Usage troubles & tricks</A></TH>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.0">2.0</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>I run xmgr and get the following error messages:
<P>
Warning: translation table syntax error: Unknown keysym name: osfPageLeft<BR>
Warning: ... found while parsing '&lt;Key&gt;osfPageLeft:SWLeftPage()'<BR>
[...]
</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Get the XKeySymDB file from the X11R6 distribution.  Put it somewhere
where you can get at it and 
<P>
  setenv XKEYSYMDB /place/where/you/put/XKeysymDB
<P>
This will satisfy xmgr.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.1">2.1</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>How do I set the background color of a plot,
outside of the graph frame?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Use graph 0 as the background:<BR>
 1.  set the viewport for graph 0 such that 0 &lt; x &lt; 1 and 0 &lt; y &lt; 1<BR>
 2.  fill the frame of graph 0 with whatever color you want<BR>
 3.  graphs 1 and up will plot in front of graph 0, so the desired
         effect is achieved.
<P>
You can also add
<P>
<CODE>
  background color NUMBER
</CODE>
<P>
to your <I>~/.xmgrrc</I>, or use
<CODE>
  xmgr -pexec "background color NUMBER"
</CODE>
<P>
This changes the background of the entire canvas, not only the 
background of graphs.
<P>
From version 4.1.0 and up, this can be done using the "Options/Page" popup as well.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.2">2.2</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>I'd like plot data against an axis on the right (top) and another
data set in a different scale against an axis on the left (bottom)?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Use overlaying graphs. With this you can achieve 
the desired effect, but you'll need to pay close
attention to which graph is the 'current' graph.
This is also how to plot data sets in different
scales against an axis on the right an an axis on
the left.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.3">2.3</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>Can I use different fonts, symbols, font size, or
sub/superscripts in Xmgr?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Yes, Xmgr has all these features. Wherever you can
type a text in xmgr, e.g. Axis labels, graph title,
text from Strings&Things, etc., you can use all
those features within the same text.<BR>
Please refer to the "Help/User Guide", section
"Fonts, subscripts, superscripts". There are some
limitations, though, which are also discussed
there.</TD>

    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>Where is grbatch? How does batch printing work?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Grbatch is simply a copy of xmgr named grbatch or a symbolic link from 
xmgr to grbatch. In the case of the symbolic link:
<P>
 ln -s xmgr grbatch
<P>
done wherever the xmgr binary is located will do the trick (rehash
or logout and login to make sure that grbatch shows up in your path).
Executing grbatch with no command line parameters or data files will produce 
a hardcopy on the default printer.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.6">2.6</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>I can't anymore print to a PostScript printer.
Prior to xmgr-4, this worked fine.</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The changes in the PostScript driver for fills
using patterns, introduced in 4.00, require use of
a Level 2 compliant PostScript printer. You can
disable the PS Level 2 features in the printer
setup as well as  with the command-line switch 
`-nops2'.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.7">2.7</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>I get all kinds of weirdness with xmgr-4 on Linux.
I'm using a precompiled binary.</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The problem is in the libc incompatibility. 
The README.Linux file, found in the
same directory you downloaded the binary from, lists the proper library version.
You'll have to upgrade your system. Starting with version 4.1.1, the static binary is
not provided anymore, since it is impossible to include support for dynamic modules in a
static executable.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.8">2.8</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>When I load to the xmgr-4 a project saved with an
earlier version of xmgr, symbols of all (some)
sets are drawn in the black color.</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The xmgr-4 fixed the relict symbol-color bug. Previously (since xmgr-3)
all symbols by default were asigned the black color, but drawn using the line
color. The fix thus would break any project saved with a post-2 version of
xmgr, unless  symbol colors were explicitly defined. To overcome this, the new
`-symcolorbug' flag  should be used to load such a project.  Once saved, it can
be open in a usual way.  Projects saved with a 2.* version of x[m,v]gr (which
didn't have the option to change the symbol color independently) will be
converted automatically.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.9">2.9</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>How do I do polar plots with XMGR?</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>The support for polar plots is very limited as of
now (4.1.0), though the situation may change soon.
The polar coordinates can be selected from the
"Data/Graph ops/Type".</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.10">2.10</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>When I use exponential (or any other non-linear)
regression, the resulting parameters are wrong,
though the fitting curve itself is OK.</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>For linear fits (y=ax+b) a straightforward least squares procedure is
used. For exponential and power fits, the function to fit is linearized,
it is important to note that the statistics generated refer to the
parameters of the <I>linearized</I> function and
not the original one.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.11">2.11</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>With xmgr-4.1.0, I can't open anymore project files
saved with a prior version of the program</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>In xmgr-4.1.0, support for the binary file format
(the former default one) was dropped. You must use
the `grconvert' utility supplied with the xmgr 
distribution in order to convert the files.</TD>

<TR><TH WIDTH="10%" ROWSPAN=2 VALIGN=TOP><A NAME="2.12">2.12</A></TH>
    <TH VALIGN=TOP WIDTH="5%">Q:</TH><TD>Xmgr can not find help files</TD>
<TR><TH VALIGN=TOP>A:</TH><TD>Set the <B>GR_HOME</B> environment variable to your xmgr
