	<h3> Changing fonts within a string </h3>
<p>
To change fonts within a string precede the font number listed below by a
backslash. To  turn subscripting or superscripting on or off use \s for
subscripts and \S for superscripting. Font selection is current for the
remainder of the string or until the next font change.  Subscripts and
superscripts remain for the remainder of the string or until \N is seen. To 
print a backslash use \\. To backspace use \b. To begin underlining use \u, to
stop underlining use \U. \+ increases the size of the characters and \-
decreases the size of the characters.
<p>
xmgr uses the Hershey fonts to draw text on the screen, but PostScript fonts
for hardcopy. There are discrepancies between the two sets of fonts and of this
writing, there are  problems with the mapping of Greek and special characters.
<p>
Font # 	Font
<ul>
	<li>  0 .... Complex Roman on screen, maps to Times-Roman.
	<li>  1 .... Triplex Roman on screen, maps to Times-Bold.
	<li>  2 .... Complex Italic on screen, maps to Times-Italic.
	<li>  3 .... Triplex Italic on screen, maps to Times-BoldItalic.
	<li>  4 .... Simplex on screen, maps to Helvetica.
	<li>  5 .... Duplex on screen, maps to Helvetica-Bold
	<li>  6 .... Complex Italic on screen, maps to Helvetica-Oblique.
	<li>  7 .... Triplex Italic on screen, maps to Helvetica-BoldOblique.
	<li>  8 .... Simplex Greek on screen, maps to the lower 128 characters 
	             of the Symbol font.
	<li>  9 .... Symbols on screen, maps to the upper 128 characters of the 
	             Symbol font.
	<li>  x .... Special symbols 
</ul>
<p>
Summary of other special commands
<ul>
	<li>  + .... increase size
	<li>  - .... decrease size
	<li>  b .... backspace length of previous character
	<li>  c .... begin using upper 128 characters of set
	<li>  C .... stop using upper 128 characters of set
	<li>  s .... begin subscripting
	<li>  S .... begin superscripting
	<li>  u .... begin underline
	<li>  U .... stop underline
	<li>  N .... return to normal
</ul>
<p>
Example:
<p>
 \0F\sX\N(\8e\0) = sin(\8e\0)*e\S(-X)\N*cos(\8e\0)
<p>
 prints roughly FX(e) = sin(e)*e -X*cos(e)
<p>
 using font 0 and e prints as epsilon from the Simplex Greek font. 
<p>
Use the upper 128 characters for accented characters.
The upper character set not display on the screen correctly but will
print. 
<p>
NOTE:
Special characters are mapped to the keyboard, the present mapping is not very
well  organized and may change.
