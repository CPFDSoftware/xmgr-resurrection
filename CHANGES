                             Xmgr list of changes
                                       

From 3.01 to 4.00alpha:



 * added a new demo, cd to examples and run:
   xmgr -arrange 2 2 -b test.com

 * No limit on the number of columns of block data. See the -maxblock option.

 * Added formats YYMMDD and YYMMDDHMS For tick labeling.

 * Colors can be changed on the fly.

 * Tick marks and grid lines are now set separately.

 * Added as274 for performing the least squares fits for
   polynomials, seems to be fairly robust, the default is
   the original - form the normal equations and use gauss
   elimination.

 * Allow logging of strings passed to the scanner, should help in
   debugging batch files.

 * Tick marks and gridlines are now drawn separately - you can have ticks
   OUT while having gridlines.

 * Edit points has been rearranged, the popup for the location and the
  buttons for actions are now in the same popup.

 * Added a command (LENGTH) that can be used to either truncate or lengthen a
   set.

 * Added commands to kill sets, but save the parameter settings
  (KILL <SETNUM> SAVEALL)

 * Added ARRANGE command, this does not allow the control over
  the layout that the popup does, but should be useful.

 *  [EV] proper moving of filled objects
 *  [EV] postscript now fills with patterns
 *  [PN] when editing text, the following keys are available:
         ^a - go to beginning
         ^e - go to end
         ^k - delete to end
         ^u - delete to start
 *  [ES] fix for the power regression (y = a*x^b)
 *  [ES] when compiled with XBAE, creating a new set is possible (with
         $GR_EDITOR, or vi as a default)
 *  [ES] `examples' directory cleaning
 *  [ES] extracting OS-specific or otherwise configurable parameters from
         Makefile into Make.arch and Make.conf respectively
 *  [EV] text string editing
 *  [EV] code to distinguish between postscript level 1 and 2 printers and
         alter pattern fill accordingly
 *  [EV] fix for bounding box for eps files that was sometimes computed
         incorrectly
 *  [ES] some minor code & documentation fixes and rearrangements
 *  [ES] adding a primitive `configure' script

  Patch level 1


 *  [ES] code fixes and rearrangements (still far from being complete)
 *  [ES] building a non-GUI version works out of the box now
 *  [ES] new functions added to the parser: hyperbolic (sinh, cosh, tanh) and
         inverse hyperbolic (asinh, acosh, atanh). This was suggested by Jens
         Schneider <jschneid@gluon.physik.uni-kl.de>
 *  [ES] tick marks & labels didn't show up in the zero X/Y axes if the axes
         didn't contain 0. (pointed out by James J. Szydlik
         <szydlik@cgrer.uiowa.edu>). Fixed

  Patch level 2


 *  [JK] fix for loop when processing a read command from command interpreter
 *  [ES] on-line & context-sensitive help facility added, but by now, it is
         enabled only for a small part of widgets
 *  [ES] GR_HELPVIEWER is now in the printf(3) format, with %s being replaced b
y
         a help URL anchor. The default GR_HELPVIEWER string is now
         "netscape -raise -remote openURL(%s) >/dev/null 2>&1 || netscape %s".
         This will try to connect to an already running netscape, and if fails,
         silently run a new one
 *  [ES] added support for libhelp (tested with ver. 1.8.1) - a light-weight
         hypertext help system of Thomas Harrer. If this is enabled,
         GR_HELPVIEWER will be ignored. See Make.conf for more details
 *  [ES] documentation a bit updated
 *  [ES] in the print setup, option to disable PS Level 2 features. Should
         eliminate problems some people encountered with old printers
 *  [EV] Xbae cell editing fixes
 *  [EV] added interpolation: create a new set by performing interpolation on
         one set at abscissas from another set. Can be done by linear, cubic
         spline or Akima spline (see below) approximation
 *  [EV] in "Edit/Create set", option to define new set by a formula
 *  [ES] fixes for custom positioning of axis labels: both dx and dy work and
         are updated under axis flip/invert correctly
 *  [ES] menus rearranged
 *  [ES] Akima splines added. Nice when approximating essentially non-smooth
         series. The code is taken from David Frey's Spline-1.0 package and
         modified to suite xmgr
 *  [EV] option to strip absolute path from legend strings when data is read
         from a file
 *  [EV] if reading data from file a, the first column of data is commented a:1

         and the next a:2, etc
 *  [EV] when printing to a file, default filename is the project name +
         type-specific extension; file selection widget added
 *  [ES] new functions in parser:
         interpolation: INTERP (SET1, SET2, method), where the method
            could be either 0 (linear), 1 (cubic spline) or 2 (Akima spline)
         Akima spline: ASPLINE(SET, START, STOP, NPOINTS)
 *  [EV] fix for string edit popup - the rotation angle was not updated
 *  [EV] fix for the U umlaut - \c\\ should work as expected

  Patch level 3


 *  [ES] non-linear fit rewritten
 *  [ES] misc bug fixes
 *  [ES] "File/Open" automatically distinguish between type of project (binary/
         ascii). "File/Save" has option to choose the type

 *  [EV] project description (binary format only)
 *  [EV] added project name to footer string
 *  [EV] verify overwrite on "File/Save"
 *  [EV] "All line styles" and "B/W" options in "Plot/Symbols"
 *  [SB] reducing size of PostScript files by inserting symbol definitions;
         some code fixes
 *  [EV] graph arrange enhancements
 *  [ES] new symbol types: "Location X", "Location Y", and "Location (X,Y)";
         the former "Loc" renamed to "Index"
 *  [ES] switch to pulldown/pullright menus
 *  [ES] Ultrix port



  Patch level 4


 *  [RN] some VMS fixes
 *  [ES] N-tiles removed from Data/Transformations. It didn't work, and since
         nobody had complained, I decided nobody needs it
 *  [ES] set sorting bug (todo rep. #24) fixed (annotation was reversed)
 *  [BA] frequency scale for FFT was not accurate, often off by up to 15%
 *  [HS] contributed 3 color xpm icons for use with a window manager
 *  [EV] added "Add", "Delete", and "Update" functions to the set editor (Xbae
         version)
 *  [EV] proper cycling of the world view stack
 *  [EV] multiple select for the symbol widget and autoselect for 1 set
 *  [ES] "Edit/Create set" window looks same with and without Xbae
 *  [ES] legend length 0 allowed - shows only one symbol
 *  [ES] config file for SunOS 4 (reported to work by Pete Phillips
         <pete@smtl.co.uk>)
 *  [ES] "Location *" symbols centered horizontally and shifted a bit
         vertically
 *  [ES] added the `-nops2' flag to the command line switches (no PS Level2)
 *  [ES] `-help' aliased to `-usage'; the help printout fits into 80-char lines
 *  [ES] format of output in the non-linear fit & integration windows changed
         from float to general
 *  [ES] fixed bug in parameters file save routine causing font width of
         subtitle to be set to the title's font width
 *  [ES] checks for dirty state of project are done. xmgr will prompt to save
         current project upon exit only if some changes are made
 *  [EV] 2 color filling bugs in bar charts fixed
 *  [EV] gap between label and frame changes with vertical gap
 *  [EV] autoscaling leaves the precision of the axis (todo rep. #4)
 *  [EV] `all sets' button added to all pertinent transformations
         (todo rep. #6)
 *  [EV] discrepancy between placed text and move text frame eliminated
 *  [EV] resize graph by double clicking focus markers
 *  [EV] problems with being unable to pick objects fixed
 *  [EV] documentation updates
 *  [HH/HS] "Write/Sets"  segfaulted if xmgr was compiled w/o NetCDF support
 *  [HH/HS] XCOR command enabled in batch processing
 *  [ES] quotes in text strings weren't saved correctly in the ascii save
         format & interpreted by the command tool (todo rep. #18) (in fact,
         there were 2 independent bugs)
 *  [ES] config file for SCO (reported to work on SCO Open Server 5.0 by
         Eugene L. Willey <gw51637@navix.net>)
 *  [SB] patches to get on-the-fly color changing working - the "cmap" command
         works after having started xmgr
 *  [ES] fixed the relict symbol-color bug. Previously (since xmgr-3) all
         symbols by default were assigned the black color, but drawn using the
         line color. The fix thus would break any project saved with a post-2
         version of  xmgr, unless symbol colors were explicitly defined. To
         overcome this, the new `-symcolorbug' flag should be used to load such
         a project.  Once saved, it can be open in a usual way. Projects saved
         with a 2.* version of x[m,v]gr (which didn't have the option to change
         the symbol color independently) will be converted automatically
 *  [ES] in "Plot/Symbols", changing a line color causes the symbol color to
         become the same. I think it's what most of people would expect. If you
         need the symbols drawn in another color, change it _after_ the
         line color has been selected
 *  [ES] signal and WM event handling. xmgr will ask about confirmation if you
         try to kill it in any way while the current project isn't saved
 *  [JH] changes to make xmgr compile on VMS with MultiNet
 *  [ES] menus are now fully configurable - you can assign any hotkey to any
         item. Refer to the xmgr documentation for the list of available X
         resources
 *  [ES] added compiled-in fallback resources. The XMgr.ad isn't installed by
         default anymore
 *  [EV] conversion between view and world coordinates when editing objects
         (todo rep. #2)
 *  [ES] added "Comments" item to the "Help" menu for on-line bug/wish reports
 *  [ES] misc tiny fixes (including todo rep. #21)



  Patch level 5


 *  [ES] undefined variable "tbuf" in editpwin.c if compiled without Xbae
         (todo rep. #49)
 *  [ES] pressing "Help" in error dialogs caused segfault (todo rep. #34)
 *  [KM] xmgr died on Digital Unix 4.0B as soon as one clicked in the main
         window (todo rep. #56)
 *  [HS] added `xmgr.static' and `xmgr.semistatic' targets in Makefiles
 *  [HS] fixed circle symbols no drawn with radius < 17 (todo rep. #37)
 *  [HS] fixed error message in "Create set/By formula" (todo rep. #36)
 *  [HS] fixed handling of mouse events while tracking points (todo rep. #42)
 *  [HS] fixed segfault if no sets selected in "Data/Point ops/Track"
         (todo rep. #47)
 *  [HS] page layout is saved with project (ASCII and binary) (todo rep. #29)
 *  [HS] added "All but" to "Reactivate sets"
 *  [HS] added PS line scaling adjustments to the print setup (todo rep. #25)
 *  [HS] PS line scaling is saved with ASCII projects (todo rep. #25)
 *  [HS] date and email is saved in PS files (for Linux only)
 *  [HS] added expressions "y.max", "y.sd" etc.
 *  [ES] fixed crashes when selecting "apply to all axes" in axis popup
         (todo rep. #50)
 *  [ES] "Extract points" from region ignored selected set (todo rep. #23)
 *  [ES] "Region ops/Evaluate" didn't work (todo rep. #40)
 *  [ES] made set selection type "SINGLE" in all region operations so to not
         confuse people (todo rep. #58)
 *  [JH] symbol `overlay' clashed with a VMS VAX/Multinet define
         (todo rep. #57)
 *  [ES] Ymax or Xmax tick labels and ticks were missing sometimes
         (todo rep. #19)
 *  [ES] "Data/Transformation/Sample points" by logical expression didn't work
         (todo rep. #28)
 *  [ES] some tiny fixes



From 4.0 and up





  4.0.1


 *  [HS] batch calculations were performed only for the first element of each
         set (todo rep. #55); this was announced to be, but mistakenly not
         included in 4.00beta.pl5
 *  [HS] made xmgr ignore lines containing only spaces; this was announced to
         be, but mistakenly not included in 4.00beta.pl5
 *  [HS] contributed section for magic(5) so file(1) would recognize xmgr
         project files
 *  [HS] command histo(setnum,start,width,num) segfaulted (todo rep. #66)
 *  [HS] allow the expressions "g0.s0.length" and "length" in addition to
         "s0.length"
 *  [HS] enabled "AUTOTICKS" command
 *  [HS] placing axis labels did not work for negative coordinates (todo
         rep. #70)
 *  [HS] changed command string for lynx help viewer (todo rep. #71)
 *  [HS] changed multiple into extended selection in set selection widgets
 *  [HS] save description with ASCII projects (todo rep. #46). This required
         the creation of new commands:
         'DESCRIPTION "Textual description"'
         'CLEAR DESCRIPTION'
 *  [HS] new command to select the default save style of projects (todo
         rep. #74):
         'DEFAULT SAVE ASCII'
         'DEFAULT SAVE BINARY'
 *  [ES] made `-h' work as `-help' instead of hardcopy print and output to
         stdout instead of stderr. Plus, there is a line at the end saying
         that |more can be used :) (todo rep. #30)
 *  [ES] replaced all occurrences of cfree() by free() to make xmgr compliant
         with glibc. xmgr should compile now on Linux/AXP
 *  [ES] xmgr segfaulted when trying to read data in the XY String format
         if strings were not quoted (todo rep. #83)
 *  [JH] the argument list for a number of routines in plotone.c contained
         the plotarr structure called by value.  This was longer than the 255
         values allowed by the VAX/VMS calling standard. Changed to calls by
         reference (todo rep. #79)
 *  [ES] linear regression worked only with n > 3, not with  n=2,3
         (todo rep. #69)
 *  [RN] the main Makefile split into  Makefile and Make.common.  Now it is
         possible to use the same definitions under UNIX and VMS
         (todo rep. #75)
 *  [ES] the "eps" radio button in the "Printer setup" window was not
         activated with the `-eps' command line option (todo rep. #96)
 *  [ES] by setting Xresource XMgr*tearOffModel: XmTEAR_OFF_DISABLED one can
         disable the tear-off behavior of menus, so to prevent VUE window
         manager crashes on HP/UX (todo rep. #43)
 *  [ES] the 'Save' function in saved always to the directory where xmgr was
         started, not to the directory the project was saved to using 'Save
         as...' (todo rep. #38)
 *  [ES] clicking on an overlapped by few graphs area now changes the focus
         in cyclic order (todo rep. #45)
 *  [ES] selecting another graph than the current one with ReadToGraph in
         the File/Read/ReadSets popup AutoscaleOnRead did not work when you
         acted for the first time on the graph (todo rep. #95)
 *  [ES] reading a binary set saved with the binary option was broken (todo
         rep. #54)
 *  [ES] although a comment was saved with every set when writing the current
         project as ASCII data, this comment was set to the name of the file
         when it was loaded again (todo rep. #61)
 *  [ES] the precision of the set editor in non-XBAE  version of xmgr was
         fixed, so it was impossible to edit set data with many significant
         digits (todo rep. #102). New command added:
         'DEFAULT SFORMAT formatstring' ,
         with formatstring being in the printf(3) format. This affects also
         the format used for saving (ASCII) projects and writing sets (XY only)
 *  [ES] pushing the "pack" button in status menu could overwrite inactive
         sets (todo rep. #88)
 *  [EV] after editing in the window "Edit legend labels" called from
         "Legends" and pressing "Accept" the corresponding legend in the
         window "Symbols/Legends" was not updated (todo rep. #81)
 *  [EV] frame stack cycling fixed (todo rep. #103)
 *  [EV] added "feature extraction" facilities. Given a set of curves in a
         graph, extract a feature from each curve and use the values of the
         feature to provide the Y values for a new curve. See docs for more
         details
 *  [EV] fixed the problem with the set selector when it has the active,
         inactive, etc. buttons.  When you switched graphs, it would ignore
         the setting you had selected  and use the original setting
 *  [EV] when swapping sets, the set selectors show the sets in the graph you
         are selecting from, not the current graph as before
 *  [ES] some buttons that appeared twice in "Legends" and "Edit comment
         labels" popups deleted
 *  [ES] WIN95/NT port (see README.Win32) (todo rep. #17)
 *  [HS] changed number of sets from 5 to 8 in set selection widgets
 *  [HS] documentation on `-npipe' option
 *  [HS] acegr_np library and documentation. The library contains convenient
         functions that allows to call xmgr from a C program while not loosing
         the interactiveness of xmgr. See docs for details
 *  [ES] Fortran wrapper for the acegr_np library
 *  [AM] OS/2 port (see README.OS2)
 *  [ES] signal handling can be disabled by `-nosigcatch' flag
 *  [ES] xmgr can be compiled with EDITRES support - see Make.conf
 *  [EV] 2 object filling bugs, introduced in pl5, fixed
 *  [EV] when objects were defined in viewport  coordinates, the graph
         number would be -1
 *  [EV] it is now possible to change the graph an object is associated with.
         Edit the object, convert to viewport coords, change the graph focus
         and then convert to world coord's
 *  [ES] when selecting "Draw tick marks on: Both/Opposite axis" and "Axis
         label location: Specified", the specified  location was ignored
         (todo rep. #117)
 *  [ES] one extra mark appeared to the right of the plot if one set an axis
         to logarithmic scale for some  values of xmax/ymax. The bug was
         triggered by some changes in pl5
 *  [ES] some documentation updates



  4.1.0


 *  [ES] GNU autoconf is now used to configure xmgr
 *  [ES] dropped support for inflexible and error-prune binary project format;
         added `grconvert' tool to facilitate automatic conversion of projects
         in this format to the ASCII one
 !  [HS] added new commands to parser for FFT options
 !  [HS] added DEACTIVATE SETNUM and REACTIVATE SETNUM commands to the parser
 *  [AM] deactivate in the Status popup didn't refresh the graph (todo
         rep. #153)

 *  [DH] a PostScript code generation bug fixed (todo rep. #138)
 *  [DH] changed the tick-label precision defaults to GENERAL and "6" and
         a related bug fixed (todo rep. #139)
 *  [PS] fixed two potential out-of-bounds bugs (todo reps. #141, #143)
 *  [HS] fixed the layout of the set status window (todo rep. #134)
 *  [ES] added a bunch of special math functions using the Cephes library by
         Stephen L. Moshier (todo rep. #13). See trans.html#eval for the whole
         list of functions
 *  [AM] more OS/2 fixes
 *  [AM] added info message that non-local URLs (Help->Comments) don't work
         if xmgr compiled with libhelp (todo rep. #146)
 *  [ES] changed the order of the plot element drawings: now the frame is drawn
         after the sets (todo rep. #122)
 *  [RN/JH] more VMS fixes
 *  [HS] while killing multiple sets graph redraw is called only once (todo
         rep. #147)
 *  [EV] working directory as set from the "Options" menu now acts on all i/o
         popup dialogs (todo rep. #27)
 *  [ES] the "Kill" button in the status popup acted as "soft kill" (leaving
         parameters of a killed set) which confused people (todo rep. #151)
 *  [ES] removed calls to position routine from few large window creation
         functions (todo rep. #114)

         rep. #133)
 *  [HS] a problem with the denominator of the auto/cross-correlation function
         fixed. The option "biased/unbiased" has been removed, since it makes
         no sense for the correct auto/cross-correlation function (biased and
         unbiased were just two approximations of the correct function).
         Furthermore, the "Lag:" has been renamed to "Maximum Lag:" (todo
         rep. #150)
 *  [HS] clicking on the Y-line of a set in the status window does the same
         as clicking on the X-line
 *  [EV] added docs on ellipses
 *  [EV] PSTeX driver implemented (LaTeX `graphics' package strongly
         recommended) (todo rep. #59)
 *  [EV] legend bar chart entry for nonfilled sets fixed (todo rep. #178)
 *  [EV] all colors used for set line colors (dark green, the 15th was
         overlooked previously).
 *  [EV] legend entry form made nicer to use (todo rep. #132)
 *  [EV] symbol skip fixed for certain symbols (todo rep. #167)
 *  [EV] fixed the default coloring of sets when increased beyond 30
         (todo rep. #121)
 *  [ES] Options/Page reworked
 *  [EV] background fill performed on postscript and button added under
         Options/Page (todo rep. #163)
 *  [ES] automatic resize of canvas in the "Free" page size mode (todo
         rep. #209)
 *  [EV] two more features for feature extraction: the X value of the peak Y
         and the Y value of the peak X
 *  [ES] infix operator handling bug in parser fixed (todo rep. #174)
 *  [ES] several examples in the examples/dotest sequence gave incorrect
         information (todo rep. #159)
 *  [EV] "Strip labels" in "Edit legends" failed with relative paths (todo
         rep. #175)
 *  [ES] floating point constants in lmdif1.c weren't correct for some CPU's
         (todo rep. #80)
 *  [SB] patch to allow setting of colormap entries from a parameter file
 *  [ES] parameter files read upon startup (`-param' switch) may now contain
         commands to read in data sets (as using the `-batch' command line
         switch)
 *  [YR] script to convert Origin-4 fit description files to ACE/gr's format
 *  [EV] "SetOps/PickOps/Copy" always copied to set #0 (todo rep. #194)
 *  [HS] added soft-kill button to the status popup
 !  [HS] added "Prune data" facility
 !  [HS] added "Auto redraw" button to the status popup. New command line
         options:
               -statusredraw
               -nostatusredraw
         New X-resource:
               AllowStatusRedraw
         New command:
               status auto redraw onoff
 *  [ES] source code rearrangements




  4.1.1


 *  [HS] added docs on "Prune data", REACTIVATE/DEACTIVATE and FFT parser
         commands, and auto-redraw button in the status popup
 *  [HS] minor patch for data prune if a set contained neighbored points
         with same x
 *  [ES] xmgr didn't always show the plot upon startup (seems to happen only
         with some strange X server/WM combinations)
 *  [ES] xmgr shouldn't need gmake anymore
 *  [EV] delete, replace etc buttons added to the command widget (todo
         rep. #225)
 *  [HS] mnemonics of "Transformation" submenu rearranged
 *  [ES] in saved projects, information about actual set numbering was lost,
         so loading a project with sets not packed resulted in wrong set
         attributes (todo rep. #219) (using the TARGET command, see below)
 *  [ES] new command: TARGET
            TARGET setnum
            TARGET graphno.setnum
         Define the named set to be used whenever a new set is about to be
         automatically selected and activated. If the set already exists (by
         the time a new set is needed), the command is ignored. Once the
         command succeeds, the target definition is cleared.
 *  [ES] fixed multiple definitions of some global variables (todo rep. #228)
 *  [ES] fixed few potential memory leaks in parser introduced in 4.1.0beta
 *  [ES] added possibility to run non-linear fits from batch files. The new
         command is
            NONLFIT(SETNO, NSTEPS) or
            NONLFIT(GRAPHNO.SETNO, NSTEPS)
         See docs for more details
 *  [ES] fixed bug in data array assignment by index (todo rep. #231)
 *  [ES] removed inconsistency in data array assignment by index - F77/C
         index notations were mixed, currently all indices are assumed to
         begin from 0 (todo rep. #232)
 *  [EV] both editing an existing set and creating a new one can be done with
         the Xbae editor and an external editor as well (todo rep. #218)
 *  [HS] global ispell'ing checks of docs
 *  [ES] changes to parser, including dealing with functions
 *  [HS] fixed few glitches caused by the above
 *  [ES] INVT(), INVN(), NORMP() and their sources removed. Instead, use
         STDTRI(), NDTRI() and NDTR() from the Cephes library.
         Former LOG() renamed to LOG10(); the (undocumented) definitions of
         LS and LW removed. Renamed all (undocumented) TIME STRING * commands
         to TIMESTAMP. INT() (as alias to INTEGRATE()) removed
 *  [ES] INT() (casting to integer) removed, RINT() - round to closest integer
         - added
 *  [ES] aliases introduced; new commands:
            ALIAS CHRSTR CHRSTR
         e.g., ALIAS "s" "sin" defines "s" as an alias to the sin() function.
            ALIAS FORCE onoff
         controls whether existing keywords can be overridden by aliases (off
         by default)
 *  [RN] VAX corrections to the Cephes lib
 *  [YR] an fdf2fit bug fixed
 *  [ES] support for dynamically loaded modules using dlopen() interface
         (Linux/ELF, SunOS-4-5, OSF, IRIX, AIX-4, *BSD, UnixWare and
         probably some others) and shl_load() (HP/UX) (todo rep. #256).
         Commands:
            USE CHRSTR TYPE proctype FROM CHRSTR
            USE CHRSTR TYPE proctype FROM CHRSTR ALIAS CHRSTR
         See doc/dlmodule.html for description and examples
 *  [RN] check_float.c (in the cephes dir) that guesses type of FPU arithmetics
 *  [ES] AS274 is now the only method used for polynomial regression
 *  [ES] Trying to execute 'getp "parameterfile"' in the 'commands' submenu
         resulted in program hang. (todo rep. #245)
 *  [ES] 'statusredraw' and 'nostatusredraw' command-line options misspelled
         in the 'xmgr -h' output (todo rep. #243)
 *  [ES] there was no support in the xmgr language for ticklabels location
         "Between ticks" (todo rep. #236)
 *  [HS] an npipe fix (based on a patch by Andre Bleau)
 *  [AM] OS/2 updates
 *  [ES] the time stamp (if defined) and its attributes are now saved in the
         project files (todo rep. #9)
 *  [ES] added possibility for the time stamp rotation (todo rep. #127). See
         docs for the list of the (time-stamp) related commands
 *  [ES] time stamp changes only when a project is changed
 *  [EV] incorrect Postscript output was produced if PS level 2 functions were
         disabled and pattern filled objects used (todo rep. #247)
 *  [YR] fdf2fit accepts "-" as std(in/out) definition
 *  [ES] enclosing line of a pattern-filled polygon got lost in the postscript
         output if the surrounding line was black (todo rep. #94)
 *  [RN] VAX fixes
 *  [ES] Options/Draw/Overlay removed
 *  [ES] Smith graph added to Data/Graph opts/Type (completely untested!)
 *  [HS] command window prettifying; short-keys for some operations defined
 *  [HS] by default, always open a new Netscape window when using help
 *  [ES] a glibc-2 symbol clash in the parser source eliminated (todo
         rep. #262)
 *  [ES] when iconified, a color xpm icon is displayed (requires the Xpm
         library installed)
 *  [EV] adding a point by "Point ops/add" to the beginning of a set didn't
         work
 *  [EV/ES] using grconvert for automatic on-the-fly conversion of the old
         binary format project files
 *  [ES] numerous `configure' fixes and enhancements
 *  [ES] source code rearrangements

 *  [ES] xmgr crashed on monochrome displays (todo rep. #285). A temporal
         workaround implemented
 *  [HS2] SIGSEGV caused by user ticks and 'apply to all axes' (todo rep. #300)
 *  [ES] configuration/compilation problems on some platforms fixed (todo reps.
         #321, #322, #330, #331, #343, #365, #380, #390)
