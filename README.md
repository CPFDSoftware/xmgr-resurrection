Xmgr 4.1.2 - Resurrection
=========================

This is a patched version of the ancient xmgr 4.1.2
plotting program that fixes a bug that would cause a
crash on newer 64-bit machines. It also contains updated
autotools for correct recognition of MacOS.

Why?
----

Because some people cannot come to terms with the updated
[Grace](http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace) user
interface and would rather stick to the old xmgr (development
frozen in 1998).
