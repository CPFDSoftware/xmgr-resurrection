Xmgr 4.1.2 - resurrection
=========================

This is a patched version of the ancient xmgr 4.1.2
plotting program that fixes a bug that would cause a
crash on newer 64-bit machines. We have also changed
the build system to [CMake](http://www.cmake.org).

Building
--------

    $ cmake .
    $ make

Why?
----

Because some people cannot come to terms with the updated
[Grace](http://plasma-gate.weizmann.ac.il/Grace) user
interface and would rather stick to xmgr (development
frozen in 1998).
