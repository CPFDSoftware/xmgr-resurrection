1. Introduction

 Rolf has ported xmgr to VMS with assistance from John.

  We have compiled it with the following combinations:
     VMS VAX V5.5      DECC V5.2                   (Rolf)
     VMS Alpha V6.2    DECC V5.0                   (Rolf)
     VMS Alpha V7.1    DECC V5.7                   (Rolf)
     VMS VAX V6.2      DECC V5.6     Motif 1.2-4   (John)
     VMS Alpha V6.2    DECC V5.6     Motif 1.2-4   (John)
  We have also received a report that it compiled with
     VMS Alpha V6.1    DECC V5.7     Motif 1.2-3

 You need mms or mmk to compile it.  You can get mmk from

     ftp://ftp.madgoat.com/madgoat/mmk.zip

2. Compilation

 In the top directory, do

    @[.arch.vms]configure
    mms               (or mmk)

 If you wish to compile XMGR with support for HDF (or CDF)
 file format, edit [.SRC]DESCRIP.MMS after running configure.com,
 and change it as shown below:

    NETCDF = ,HAVE_MFHDF=1
    NETCDF_INC = ,USR_INC:[HDF]    # the c header files
    NETCDF_LIBS = ,USR_LIB:MFHDF.OLB,DF.OLB/LIB,LIBZ.OLB/LIB # the libraries

 Note the comma as the first character!

 You can find the NETCDF package at ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/HDF/,
 including precompiled binaries for VAX and Alpha.

3. Installation

 Define a symbol for the executable like

  $ xmgr :== $disk:[path]xmgr

 Define the following logicals

  $ define GR_HOME "/disk/dir1/dir2/xmgr/"
  ! the path of the directotry [.doc] (unix-like)

 optional:

  $ define GR_HELPVIEWER "www-browser %s"
  ! for netscape look at the original make.conf

  $ define GR_PS_PRSTR  " "print/name=""from XMGR""/delete/queue=your_queue"
  ! the /delete qualifier is recommended

 x-resources:

  The file [.SRC]XMGR.AD contains the x resources.  You may want to
  copy this file to XMGR.DAT in either DECW$SYSTEM_DEFAULTS and/or
  DECW$USER_DEFAULTS to customize the program.

4. Test

  $ set default [.examples]
  $ @dotest

5. Bugs

 Please send bug reports to the xmgr mailing list.
