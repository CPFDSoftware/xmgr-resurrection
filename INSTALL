1. CONFIGURATION
   a) read README.configure for basic notes on the GNU configure usage
   b) run `./configure --help' to get list of additional switches specific to
      ACE/gr
   c) run `./configure <options>'
      Just an example:
      ./configure --enable-acegr-home=/opt/xmgr --enable-editres \
                  --enable-extra-incpath=/usr/local/include:/opt/include \
                  --enable-extra-ldpath=/usr/local/lib:/opt/lib --prefix=/usr
      
      would (try to) configure ACE/gr with support for editres, use
      /usr/local/include and /opt/include in addition to the default include
      path and /usr/local/lib and /opt/lib in addition to the default ld path.
      As well, all stuff would be put under the /opt/xmgr directory and soft
      links made to /usr/bin, /usr/lib and /usr/include.

      *** NOTE *** If you change one of the '--enable-extra-incpath' or
      '--enable-extra-ldpath' options from one run of configure to another,
      remember to delete the "config.cache" file!!!
   
      There is one configure switch which must be paid a special attention to: 
      `--enable-config'. Some pre-defined configurations exist: look in the
      `conf' direcory for the list. Some OS/hardware combinations have more than
      one configuration file - you'll have to use the switch to choose an
      alternative one.
   d) check config.h and Make.conf (produced from the respective .in files by
      "configure")

2. COMPILING

   issue `make'

   If something goes wrong, try to see if the problem has been described
   already in the ACE/gr FAQ (in the "doc" directory).

3. TESTING

   make tests

4. INSTALLATION

   make install
   make links
   
   The later (optional) step will make soft links from some files under the
   ACE/gr home directory to the system-wide default locations (can be changed
   by the `--prefix' option at the 1.a step)
